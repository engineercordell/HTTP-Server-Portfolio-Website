                            Hey there—My name is Cordell Palmer. In December 2024, I graduated from Georgia Tech
                            with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering and a Minor in Computer Science, with a focus on Machine Learning.
                            During my undergraduate years, I was able to cultivate a broad set of skills, having obtained proficiency in areas such as
                            CAD modeling/3D printing, structural analysis, software and hardware programming, AI, robotics, and wide range of electrical and mechanical
                            data analysis/manufacturing tools. Despite my background being primarily rooted in mechanical systems, my true passion lies at the intersection of hardware, 
                            software, and AI development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since graduation I've deeply immersed myself in systems development, having written the HTTP server that
                            runs this website from scratch in C++ with barebones kernel APIs. The journey to enrich my understanding of networking, memory, and 
                            OS-level architecture has sparked an ever evolving passion in all things embedded systems, FPGAs, digital circuitry, and future-forward
                            technologies like graphene semiconductors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In short: I enjoy building things that closely interact with our world, and this is only the beginning.
                        </p>
